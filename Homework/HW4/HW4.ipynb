        "Financial institutions that lend to consumers rely on models to help decide on who to approve or decline for credit (for lending products such as credit cards, automobile loans, or home loans). In this project, your task is to develop models that review credit card applications to determine which ones should be approved. You are given historical data on response (binary default indicator) and 20 predictor variables from credit card accounts for a hypothetical bank XYZ, a regional bank in the Bay area. There are three datasets available: a [training](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mh2t/CS6140/main/Homework/HW4/HW4-Train.csv) dataset with 20,000 accounts; a [validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mh2t/CS6140/main/Homework/HW4/HW4-Validation.csv) dataset with 3,000 accounts, and a **hidden** test dataset with 5,000 accounts. Information about the variables is given in the [Appendix](https://github.com/mh2t/CS6140/blob/main/Homework/HW4/HW4-appx.pdf).\n",

        "* **(20 points)** Develop and fit a logistic regression (LR) model, assess its performance, and interpret the results.\n",
        "* **(20 points)** Develop an additional model based on a machine learning (ML) algorithm selected from one of the following: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost or another implementation), or Feedforward Neural Network; assess its performance, and make sure to explain why you chose this particular algorithm.\n",
        "* **(10 points)** Compare the results from the ML algorithm with those from logistic regression model and discuss their advantages and disadvantages; select one of these models for credit approval; and describe the reasons for your selection.\n",
        "* **(5 points)** Describe what performance metrics you chose to evalaute your proposed models and why.\n",
        "* **(10 points)** Describe how you would use it to make decisions on future credit card applications.\n",
        "* **(5 points)** Do customers who already have an account with the financial institution receive any favorable treatment in your model? Support your answer with appropriate analysis.\n",

        "3. You are allowed to review textbooks, published papers, websites, and other open literature in preparing for this homework. Note, however, that the material you submit in your report must be based on your own analysis and writing. If you relied on published scholarly work and open-source software for your analysis and findings (beyond what is generally known), you should provide references at the end of the report.\n"
